# Smart Box IoT
## A smart box to measure the weather out in the fields

This repository contains the final project for the IoT exam.

## Quick Start

Note: This repository uses git lfs to store images and pdfs with big sizes, [install it](https://git-lfs.github.com/) before cloning the repository to make sure all the files are properly downloaded.

Before compiling the projects you need to tell arduino the location of the custom library; to do so create a symbolic link to the library in the arduino folder

```console
$ cd path/to/arduino/libraries
$ ln -s path/to/smart/sense/lib/sensor_util sensor_util
```

To use the machine learning library generated by EdgeImpulse you need to include it as a library in Arduino

### Using Arduino IDE

If you are using the Arduino IDE navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add .ZIP Library" and select `iot_inferencing.zip`.

### Using Arduino CLI

If you are using the Arguino CLI you need to extract the `iot_inferencing.zip` into your local arduino folder

```console
$ unzip iot_inferencing.zip -d path/to/arduino/libraries
```
