## A smart box to measure the weather out in the fields

This is the final project for the IoT exam.

### Quick Start

Before compiling the projects you need to tell arduino the location of the custom library; to do so create a symbolic link to the library in the arduino folder

```console
$ cd path/to/arduino/libraries
$ ln -s path/to/smart/sense/lib/sensor_util sensor_util
```
